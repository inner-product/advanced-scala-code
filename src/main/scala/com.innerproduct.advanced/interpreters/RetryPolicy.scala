/** Specify effect retry policies as an algebra, run them with an interpreter.
  *
  * Totally stolen from https://cb372.github.io/cats-retry.
  *
  * The algebra is the interface. It consists of:
  *
  * 1. introduction forms: creates an elements of our "algebra" from some other data;
  * 2. combinators: combines elements of our "algebra"; and
  * 3. elimination forms: turns elements of our algebra into some other type (usually by running the program specified in the algebra).
  *
  * "Reification" means to make something abstract concrete. Concretely in our case it means to turn method calls into data.
  *
  * Steps to implementing a reified interpreter:
  *
  * 1. Write out the type definitions or interface of the algebra.
  * 2. Reify all the introduction and composition forms, usually as an algebraic data type.
  * 3. Implement the interpreter in the elimination forms, usually as a structural recursion over the ADT.

    * Retry policies should be applied when the effect fails, i.e.,
    * via `handleErrorWith` or some variant.
    *
    * Important implementation considerations:
    * - Some policies require cumulative information not available in the ADT itself, like
    *   the total amount of delay so far. How can this information be carried along inside
    *   the interpreter?
    *
    * Optional functionality:
    * - You may want to log about the current failure and retry strategy via the `debug` extension method.
    * - Alternatively, the caller could provide a callback that is given information about the current
    *   failure and retry strategy, returning an `IO[Unit]`.
    *
    * @param io is the effect to apply the retry policy to.
    * @param cs is a `ContextShift[IO]` you might need in order to run effects in parallel.
    * @param timer is a `Timer[IO]` you might need in order to create a "sleep" effect.
